## TO THE INSTRUCTOR
Dear Çağıl Hoca, 
This course at Atılım University was the only truly useful class we had throughout our entire education. We did not take any other course that was as valuable both theoretically and practically. We are deeply grateful for your extraordinary effort to teach us something real. We will never forget your dedication and heartfelt conversations. It was a privilege for us to work with an educator of such high quality at this school.

We hope you encounter and work with people who value your vast knowledge, extraordinary effort, and sincere character even more. From the bottom of our hearts, we thank you for everything.

With love and respect ♥
